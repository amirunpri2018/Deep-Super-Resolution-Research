Also the reason why training GAN especially in this domain is even much harder given
the generator is completely oblivious to input and instead of improving on it is 
constantly trying to minimize discriminator losses. The results of 42 is pure pixel based
the 52 one is content+adversarial with content as a regularizer

We can try a GAN as a regularizer. A regularizer actually decreases the loss factor
So we can mitigate the patches having green borders. Also we are following SRGAN
And going with two layers of the final 4 and 5 layers in VGG16
