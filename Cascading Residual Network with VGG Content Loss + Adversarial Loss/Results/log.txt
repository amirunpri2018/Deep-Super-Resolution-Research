* Stopped at 42 with only pix loss for normalised data
* starting with content loss + adv loss with 0.006 and 0.001
* The GAN is simply collapsing again and again cant control the mod collapse
  Cant figure out why, i am looking back into the API again if by mistake
  the discriminator if is getting trained can be an issue
