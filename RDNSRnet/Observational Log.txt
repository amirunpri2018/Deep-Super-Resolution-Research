log1: 7:36 4 July : for image 0016.jpg the reconstruction has issue with finer details with artifacts like water drops.
                    also there is incoherence between some patches only noticable with high zoom levels. There are no
                    lines but you can see a discontinuity in between the patches.
log2: 13:19 6 July: 4x and 2x gives fine results. Though in some images where the color is uniform but there is change
                    in texture . e.g grass or green in see bed etc. Anything with uniform colour but changing texture looses
                    its texture details.

NEW MODEL
log3: 18:02 7 July: I have added content loss to the architecture. the layer relu3_3 or block3_con3 in Keras is used to generate
		    Content loss. the VGG model is first compiled  up till the required layer. The output from these layers are than taken 
		    and then computed the loss which is not part of the loss function but as a compute graph. We compare the output to
		    0 and compute a mse loss hence having the loss backpropagate.
		    So we are now using pretrained weights of the 4x zoom model to accelerate training.
